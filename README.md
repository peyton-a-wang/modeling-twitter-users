The purpose of our Data Structures final project was to determine which fake Russian Twitter accounts were involved in spreading inaccurate information during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. The program models the network of Twitter bots and tweets using Java graphs and implements breadth and depth first searches to synthesize necessary data for our analyses. After compiling the data, we drew conclusions about the most popular users, trends in graph connectivity, and most frequently tweeted stories.
